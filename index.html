<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Copyright developed originally as a privilege granted to approved printers of books, who were given an exclusive license to print some particular work. It was a whitelist form of censorship: no one could print anything unless they had been granted the copyright to do so.</font>

is Copyright?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> The basis of copyright protection in the U.S. is the Copyright Act of 1976. It grants authors and artists the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and display their works. The only exception to this protection is works for hire. If you draft a website for another entity and the contract grants ownership of its elements to it, you do not enjoy copyright protection and your client can use the website material however they wish. </font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> The right to reproduce works. The reproduction right grants the copyright owner the ability to control the making of a copy of the work. It is arguably the most important of the rights as it is implicated in most copyright infringement disputes. </font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> On October 28, 1998, President Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Act, H.R.2281. The Act was designed to increase the protection given to copyrighted works on the Internet. The new law makes it illegal to circumvent technological measures that block access to copyrighted works and to distribute false information about a work such as the identity of its author and conditions for use. </font>
